- **Real-time Preview:** Filter results summary before export
- **Empty Results Handling:** Clear user notification with disabled export button

### User Feedback & Delivery
- **Generation Process:** Loading spinner with progress indication (up to 10 seconds)
- **Report Delivery:** Automatic browser download upon completion
- **File Naming Convention:** `CertificationReport_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.pdf`
- **Concurrent Limitation:** Sequential report generation per user session

## Functional Requirements

### Data Structure & Business Logic

#### Certification Status Management
1. **Completed Certifications:** All stages and tasks successfully finished within timeframes
2. **In-Progress Certifications:** Active certifications with incomplete stages/tasks
3. **Failed Certifications:** Tasks not completed successfully or missed deadlines

#### Employee Inclusion Rules
- Include all selected employees regardless of certification status
- Display clear messaging for employees without certifications during selected period
- Message: "No certification process completed or running during selected period"

#### Time-Based Filtering
- Filter based on task-level date overlap with selected period
- Include certifications of all statuses within the date range
- Capture partial overlaps (certifications extending beyond selected period)

### Report Structure & Content

#### PDF Format Specifications
- **Page Size:** A4 (210 × 297 mm)
- **Orientation:** Landscape
- **Optimization:** Dual-optimized for digital viewing and printing
- **Visual Design:** Professional appearance with clear status indicators

#### Report Organization (Per Employee)

**Section 1: Employee Demographics**
- Employee name
- Email address
- Department
- Manager name
- Job title

**Section 2: Certifications Summary (Grouped by Status)**
- Certification name
- Overall completion status (Completed/In-Progress/Failed)
- Number of completed stages
- Current in-progress stage (if applicable)
- Visual status indicators (colors/icons for quick recognition)

**Section 3: Detailed Activities (Optional - User Controlled)**
- Organized by certification, then by stage within certification
- **Activity Information per Task:**
  - Activity type (eLearning/Class/Practical/Supervised)
  - Activity name
  - Supervisor name (for supervised activities only)
  - Supervisor notes/comments
  - Task status with visual indicators
  - Start date
  - Completion date (if completed)
- Chronological ordering within each certification stage

#### Visual Design Elements
- **Status Indicators:** Distinct colors and icons for completed, in-progress, and failed items
- **Professional Layout:** Clean, audit-ready presentation
- **Clear Typography:** Optimized for both screen reading and printing
- **Consistent Formatting:** Standardized spacing and alignment throughout
