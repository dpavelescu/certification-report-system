   - Are there any branding or styling requirements for the PDF?

3. **Technical Requirements**
   - What is the expected data volume (number of employees, certifications, tasks)?
   - How will the application access the external data source?
   - Should users be able to cancel report generation in progress?
   - Are there any specific browser compatibility requirements?

4. **User Experience**
   - What specific feedback should users receive during report generation?
   - How should reports be delivered to users (download, email)?
   - Should the application show estimated completion time?

5. **Future Considerations**
   - What metrics should be tracked to evaluate the success of this feature?
   - Are there any known future requirements that should inform the design?
   - What is the expected evolution of this feature after the MVP?

**Status:** Awaiting clarification from stakeholder

## Iteration #2

### Stakeholder Input (Clarifications Received)
**Date:** June 7, 2025

**User Interface & Flow:**
- Navigation: Landing page with filtering and export button during MVP
- Filter controls: According to best practices
- Filter saving: Not required for MVP

**Report Details:**
- Employee demographics: Only the mentioned fields (name, email, department, manager, job)
- Certification information: Name, completion status, completed stages, current in-progress stage
- Task state symbols: Established icons showing completion, failure, in-progress (no specific requirements)
- Activity format: Table format with relevant icons
- PDF styling: No specific branding requirements - "impress me"

**Technical Requirements:**
- Data volume: 100s of employees, 5-10 certifications, 2-5 stages per cert, 1-5 tasks per stage
- Data source: Mocked data for MVP (no real external source)
- Report cancellation: Not needed for MVP (given 10-second generation target)
- Browser compatibility: No specific requirements

**User Experience:**
- Generation feedback: Spinner if process takes time (up to 10 seconds)
- Report delivery: Automatic browser download
- Completion time estimate: Not required for MVP

### Product Manager Proposal
**Follow-up Questions Required:**

**Data Structure & Business Logic:**
1. Should the filtering allow selection of specific certifications or all certifications for selected employees?
2. When filtering by date range, should this be based on certification start date, end date, or both?
3. How should incomplete certifications be handled in the time-based filtering?
4. What happens if an employee has no certifications - should they appear in the report?

**Report Layout & Content:**
5. For Section 2 (certifications), should certifications be grouped by status (completed vs in-progress)?
6. In Section 3 (detailed activities), should activities be grouped by certification or presented as one chronological list?
7. What level of detail is needed for each activity (just name and status, or include dates, duration, supervisor info)?
8. Should the report include summary statistics (total employees, completion rates, etc.)?

**Performance & Technical:**
9. What file naming convention should be used for downloaded PDFs?
10. Should there be any validation on filter selections (e.g., max date range, max employees)?
11. What should happen if the filtered selection would result in an empty report?

**MVP Validation:**
12. What would constitute a successful MVP - what metrics or user feedback would validate the solution?

**Status:** Awaiting additional clarifications

**Associated PRD:** [prd-iteration-2.md](./prd-iteration-2.md)

## Iteration #3

### Stakeholder Input (Additional Clarifications Received)
**Date:** June 7, 2025

**Data Structure & Business Logic:**
- Certification filtering: Specific certifications with cascaded filtering (show only applicable certifications for selected employees)
- Date range filtering: Based on task overlap - select certifications with any task overlap with selected period
- Incomplete certifications: Present completed, not completed, and failed certifications (where employee didn't complete tasks successfully)
- Employees without certifications: Include in report with mention "no certification process completed or running during selected period"

**Report Layout & Content:**
- Section 2 grouping: All sections repeated per employee, grouped by status within each employee
- Section 3 activities: Presented certification by certification within context of specific certification stage
- Activity detail level: Activity type, name, supervisor (if supervised), supervisor note, status, start date, completion date
- Summary statistics: Not required for MVP

**Performance & Technical:**
- PDF naming: Include date and timestamp of report generation
- Filter validation: Not initially required
- Empty report handling: Notify user and keep export button disabled
- MVP success criteria: Small file size for 300-page reports, 10-second generation, optimized memory/CPU, support for 5 large parallel reports

### Product Manager Proposal
**Final Clarification Questions:**

**Visual Design:**
1. Should there be specific visual indicators (colors, icons) to distinguish between completed, in-progress, and failed certifications/tasks?
2. Are there any accessibility requirements to consider for the PDF report?

**PDF Format:**
3. Are there specific PDF format requirements (A4, letter size, orientation)?
4. Should the PDF be optimized for digital viewing or printing or both?

**System Behavior:**
5. Should the system provide an option to retry if report generation fails?
6. Should there be a limit to how many reports a user can generate in a session?

**Status:** Final clarifications needed before PRD development

**Associated PRD:** [prd-iteration-3.md](./prd-iteration-3.md)
