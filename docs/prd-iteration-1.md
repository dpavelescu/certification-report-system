# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Iteration #1
## Employee Certification Reporting System

**Document Version:** Iteration 1  
**Date:** June 7, 2025  
**Status:** Draft - Pending Clarifications

---

## Executive Summary

The Employee Certification Reporting System is a web application designed to enable managers to export employee certification data into pixel-perfect PDF reports for internal processes and external auditor compliance.

## Problem Statement

Managers need a streamlined way to generate comprehensive reports on employee certification status for:
- Internal organizational processes
- External auditor compliance requirements
- Tracking certification progress and completion

## Target Users

- **Primary Users:** Managers responsible for employee certification oversight
- **Secondary Users:** External auditors requiring certification compliance data

## Core Requirements (Initial)

### Functional Requirements

1. **Certification Data Management**
   - Support multi-stage certification processes
   - Track multiple activities per stage (eLearning, classes, practical tasks, supervised tasks)
   - Monitor completion status and time constraints

2. **Filtering and Selection**
   - Employee selection capability
   - Time period filtering (certification start/end dates)
   - Data preview before export

3. **Report Generation**
   - Three-section report structure:
     - Section 1: Employee demographics (name, email, department, manager, job)
     - Section 2: Associated certificates (all statuses)
     - Section 3: Detailed activity information (optional)
   - Chronological task ordering
   - ISO/industry symbols for task states
   - Overdue item identification

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - PDF generation within 10 seconds (up to 300 pages)
   - Memory and CPU optimization
   - Parallel report generation support

2. **User Experience**
   - Good UX during report generation
   - Export-only functionality (no long-term storage)

### Technical Constraints

- External data source (not in application scope)
- Synthetic data for MVP testing

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- User access control
- Report preview functionality
- Extensive exception handling
- Data generation application

## Open Questions & Clarifications Needed

### User Interface & Flow
- Navigation approach within application
- Specific filter control types
- Filter selection persistence

### Report Details
- Additional demographic fields
- Certification display information
- Specific ISO/industry symbols
- Activity display format
- PDF branding/styling requirements

### Technical Requirements
- Expected data volumes
- External data access method
- Report cancellation capability
- Browser compatibility needs

### User Experience
- Generation feedback mechanisms
- Report delivery method
- Completion time estimation

### Future Considerations
- Success metrics definition
- Known future requirements
- Feature evolution post-MVP

## Next Steps

1. Gather stakeholder input on open questions
2. Refine requirements based on clarifications
3. Define detailed technical specifications
4. Proceed with implementation planning
