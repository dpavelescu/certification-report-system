# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Iteration #3
## Employee Certification Reporting System

**Document Version:** Iteration 3  
**Date:** June 7, 2025  
**Status:** Draft - Final Clarifications Needed

---

## Executive Summary

The Employee Certification Reporting System is a web application that provides managers with a landing page interface featuring cascaded filtering to export employee certification data into pixel-perfect PDF reports optimized for both performance and comprehensive reporting needs.

## Problem Statement

Managers need a streamlined way to generate comprehensive reports on employee certification status for:
- Internal organizational processes
- External auditor compliance requirements
- Tracking certification progress, completion, and failures

## Target Users

- **Primary Users:** Managers responsible for employee certification oversight
- **Secondary Users:** External auditors requiring certification compliance data

## User Interface & Experience

### Navigation & Filtering
- **Landing Page:** Single page with filtering controls and export button
- **Cascaded Filtering:** Smart filtering showing only applicable certifications for selected employees
- **Date Range Logic:** Task overlap-based filtering (any task overlap with selected period)
- **Empty Results:** User notification with disabled export button for empty filter results

### User Feedback & Delivery
- **Generation Process:** Spinner display during PDF generation (up to 10 seconds)
- **Report Delivery:** Automatic browser download
- **File Naming:** Date and timestamp inclusion (e.g., "CertificationReport_2025-06-07_14-30-15.pdf")
- **Concurrent Reports:** Sequential generation per user (wait for current report completion)

## Core Requirements

### Data Structure & Business Logic

1. **Certification Status Handling**
   - **Completed:** All stages and tasks successfully finished
   - **In-Progress:** Currently active with incomplete stages/tasks
   - **Failed:** Tasks not completed successfully within timeframes

2. **Employee Inclusion Logic**
   - Include employees with no certifications during selected period
   - Display message: "No certification process completed or running during selected period"

3. **Time-Based Filtering**
   - Filter based on task start/end date overlap with selected period
   - Include all certification statuses (completed, in-progress, failed)

### Report Structure & Content

#### Report Layout (Per Employee)
- **Section 1: Employee Demographics**
  - Name, email, department, manager, job title

- **Section 2: Certifications (Grouped by Status)**
  - Certification name
  - Completion status (completed/in-progress/failed)
  - Completed stages
  - Current in-progress stage

- **Section 3: Detailed Activities (Optional, Certification by Certification)**
  - Organized by certification within specific stages
  - **Activity Details:**
    - Activity type
    - Activity name
    - Supervisor (if supervised activity)
    - Supervisor notes
    - Status
    - Start date
    - Completion date

### Performance & Technical Requirements

1. **Performance Specifications**
   - PDF generation within 10 seconds (up to 300 pages)
   - Small file size optimization for large reports
   - Memory and CPU optimization
   - Support for 5 large parallel reports system-wide

2. **Data Specifications**
   - Support 100s of employees
   - 5-10 certifications per system
   - 2-5 stages per certification
   - 1-5 tasks per stage
   - Mocked data for MVP

3. **System Behavior**
   - No filter validation initially
   - No retry functionality for MVP
   - Sequential report generation per user

## MVP Success Criteria

1. **Performance Benchmarks**
   - Small file sizes for 300-page reports
   - 10-second generation time maximum
   - Optimized memory/CPU usage
   - 5 concurrent large reports capability

2. **Functional Validation**
   - Accurate data filtering and display
   - Proper status differentiation
   - Complete activity tracking
   - Professional report appearance

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- User access control
- Report preview functionality
- Extensive exception handling
- Data generation application
- Filter selection saving
- Report generation time estimation
- Summary statistics
- Retry functionality
- Filter validation

## Remaining Questions

### Visual Design
- Specific visual indicators for status differentiation
- Accessibility requirements

### PDF Format
- Page size and orientation specifications
- Optimization priorities (digital vs. print)

### System Behavior
- Report generation failure handling
- Session-based generation limits

## Next Steps

1. Gather final visual and format specifications
2. Complete comprehensive PRD
3. Define technical architecture
4. Begin implementation planning

- Specified comprehensive activity detail requirements
- Established clear status handling (completed/in-progress/failed)
- Added file naming conventions and concurrent user behavior
- Defined MVP success criteria with specific performance metrics
- Clarified report structure with per-employee organization
