## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Iteration 1: Minimal Viable Report Generation (Completed)
- Basic landing page with employee selector
- Simple PDF report generation (Employee Demographics)
- Performance monitoring foundation
- Direct PDF download capability

### ðŸš§ Iteration 2: Complete Filtering Interface (Planned)
- Cascaded filtering (Employee â†’ Certification â†’ Date Range)
- Dynamic filter updates
- Empty state handling

### ðŸ“‹ Iteration 3: Complete Report Structure (Planned)
- Three-section reports (Demographics, Summary, Activities)
- Visual status indicators
- Professional audit-ready formatting

### ðŸ“‹ Iteration 4: Concurrency & Performance Optimization (Planned)
- Async processing with 5 concurrent reports
- Performance optimization
- Production readiness

## Performance Requirements

- **Generation Time**: Up to 20 seconds for MVP (target: 10 seconds)
- **Report Size**: Up to 300 pages
- **Concurrency**: 5 large reports simultaneously
- **Memory**: Optimized for large dataset processing

## Development Guidelines

- Follow the delivery plan for incremental development
- Maintain performance monitoring from the start
- Focus on business value delivery in each iteration
- Validate NFRs continuously throughout development
