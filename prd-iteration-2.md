# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Iteration #2
## Employee Certification Reporting System

**Document Version:** Iteration 2  
**Date:** June 7, 2025  
**Status:** Draft - Additional Clarifications Needed

---

## Executive Summary

The Employee Certification Reporting System is a web application that provides managers with a simple landing page interface to filter and export employee certification data into pixel-perfect PDF reports for internal processes and external auditor compliance.

## Problem Statement

Managers need a streamlined way to generate comprehensive reports on employee certification status for:
- Internal organizational processes
- External auditor compliance requirements
- Tracking certification progress and completion

## Target Users

- **Primary Users:** Managers responsible for employee certification oversight
- **Secondary Users:** External auditors requiring certification compliance data

## User Interface & Experience

### Navigation
- **Landing Page:** Single page with filtering controls and export button
- **Filter Controls:** Best practice implementations (dropdowns, date pickers, etc.)
- **Filter Persistence:** Not required for MVP

### User Feedback
- **Generation Process:** Spinner display during PDF generation (up to 10 seconds)
- **Report Delivery:** Automatic browser download
- **Time Estimation:** Not required for MVP

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Certification Data Management**
   - Support multi-stage certification processes (2-5 stages per certification)
   - Track multiple activities per stage (1-5 tasks per stage)
   - Monitor completion status and time constraints
   - Handle eLearning, classes, practical tasks, supervised tasks

2. **Data Volume Specifications**
   - Support 100s of employees
   - 5-10 certifications per system
   - 2-5 stages per certification
   - 1-5 tasks per stage

3. **Filtering and Selection**
   - Employee selection capability
   - Time period filtering
   - Data preview before export

4. **Report Generation**
   - **Report Structure (3 Sections):**
     - Section 1: Employee demographics (name, email, department, manager, job only)
     - Section 2: Certification information (name, completion status, completed stages, current in-progress stage)
     - Section 3: Detailed activity information (optional, table format with icons)
   - Chronological task ordering
   - Established icons for task states (completion, failure, in-progress)
   - Overdue item identification

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**
   - PDF generation within 10 seconds (up to 300 pages)
   - Memory and CPU optimization
   - Parallel report generation support

2. **Technical Specifications**
   - Mocked data for MVP (no real external data source)
   - No report cancellation needed (due to 10-second target)
   - No specific browser compatibility requirements

3. **Visual Design**
   - No specific branding requirements - creative freedom for impressive design
   - Professional appearance suitable for audit purposes

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- User access control
- Report preview functionality
- Extensive exception handling
- Data generation application
- Filter selection saving
- Report generation time estimation

## Remaining Questions

### Data Structure & Business Logic
- Specific vs. all certification filtering approach
- Date range filtering methodology
- Incomplete certification handling
- Employee with no certification handling

### Report Layout & Content
- Certification grouping by status
- Activity presentation approach (grouped vs. chronological)
- Activity detail level requirements
- Summary statistics inclusion

### Performance & Technical
- PDF file naming conventions
- Filter validation requirements
- Empty report handling

### MVP Validation
- Success criteria definition
- Performance benchmarks
- User feedback mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. Gather additional stakeholder input on remaining questions
2. Finalize detailed requirements
3. Define technical architecture
4. Begin implementation planning

**Changes from Iteration 1:**
- Defined specific UI approach (landing page)
- Clarified data volumes and structure
- Specified report content details
- Eliminated several uncertainties around technical requirements
- Refined user experience expectations
